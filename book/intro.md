# News Scraper 🗞️

> This repository is dedicated to [*Yuri Ng*](https://github.com/Geekyuri) 😉.

In this project, I have created a robust news scraper that automatically scrapes news headlines and other information, and it handles the following challenging problems:

- What to do when some websites cannot be accessed via a simple GET request?
- Some news post websites may contain several `h1` tags, and only one contains the actual headline. How to automatically extract it?
