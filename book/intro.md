# News Scraper

> This repository is dedicated to *Yuri Ng* ðŸ˜‰.

In this project, I have created a robust news scraper that will automatically scrape news headlines and other information, which handles the following challenging problems:

- What to do when some websites cannot be accessed via a simple GET request?
- Some news post websites may contain several `h1` tags, and only one contains the actual headline. How to automatically extract it?
